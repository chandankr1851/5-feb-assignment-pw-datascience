    "1.Encapsulation: It is the process of hiding the internal details of an object from the outside world and providing a public interface to interact with the object. This helps to achieve data abstraction and information hiding.\n",

    "2.Inheritance: It is the mechanism by which one class can inherit the properties and methods of another class. This allows for the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes and facilitates code reuse.\n",
